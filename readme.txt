creating a project that allows me to use the technologies at work
to get a deeper understanding of the processes that occur here
MonoRepo with the backend and frontend in one Repo 

Technologies to use -
WebBundler - Parcel
FrontEnd - React ( SinglePageApplication ) : ReactRouterConfig, React Hooks get rid of classes just functions baby
BackEnd - Micro ( miniserver to hanlde everything ) : deep dive into the composoe function
APiInterFace - Apollo-GraphQL implementation for backend & frontend
Database - MongoDB for quick setup 
Babel - as transpiler to convert es6 to browserReady syntax


Work on this Project for 2 Days MAX Finish by Wednesday 
Get back to typescript and kill that authentication package.






four screens - 
time and activity screen

time and useful index Graph screen

stats screen 

Activities List and define their values here



GraphQL Schema - Define what is going to be available from the backend to frontend 

Three Types - 
Query Type - 
Mutation Type 
Subscription  Type 

Backend Will expose - 
    What Activites have taken place and when(implicit how long)
    What Activties there are 
    by which user obviously 


What is going to be in my database ?

userID: string 
Activities: {
    name:value
}
timesheet: map{
    [startTime]:activityName,
    [endTime]:activityName 
}
